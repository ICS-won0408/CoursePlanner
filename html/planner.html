  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>In order to graduate, you must meet the minimum credit requirement, which is 25 credits. In addition to that, you must also have
     the minimum credit requirement for each type of course:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
    <li>Science: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Math: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Fine & Performing Arts: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Social Science: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Language Arts: 4.0 credits</li>
    <li>World Languages: 2.0 credits</li>
    <li>Physical Education: 2.0 credits</li>
    <li>Bible: 1.0 credit per year at ICS</li>
    <li>Information and Technology Literacy: 0.5 credits</li>
    <li>Health: 0.5 credits</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important to check college application requirements when considering which courses to take. Some collegees may want to see
     more of a certain type of course. College entry requirements vary from country to country. Taking the absolute minimum amount
     of courses is definitely not recommended and will be detrimental to your college applications. Taking to many courses
     will be extremely stressful and so you should carefully consider which courses you want to take.</p>
  <p>If you moved to ICS during high school, it is important to make sure your credits from your previous school have been properly
     transferred over.</p>
  <p>Grade 9 and 10 students must take at least 8 credits during the school year. Grade 11 and 12 students must take 7 credits.
     Study halls are assigned to blocks in which you do not have a class, with the exception of seniors. Study halls are for
     cleaning up your homework load or for studying for a quiz or test.</p>
