  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>In order to graduate, you must meet the minimum credit requirement, which is 25 credits. In addition to that, you must also have
     the minimum credit requirement for each type of course:</p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Science: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Math: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Fine & Performing Arts: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Social Science: 3.0 credits</li>
    <li>Language Arts: 4.0 credits</li>
    <li>World Languages: 2.0 credits</li>
    <li>Physical Education: 2.0 credits</li>
    <li>Bible: 1.0 credit per year</li>
    <li>Information and Technology Literacy: 0.5 credits</li>
    <li>Health: 0.5 credits</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is important to check college application requirements when considering which courses to take. Some collegees may want to see
     more of a certain type of course. College entry requirements vary from country to country. Taking the absolute minimum amount
     of courses is definitely not recommended and will be detrimental to your college applications. Taking to many courses
     will be extremely stressful and so you should carefully consider which courses you want to take.</p>
  <p>If you moved to ICS during high school, it is important to make sure your credits from your previous school have been properly
     transferred over.</p>
  <p>Grade 9 and 10 students must take at least 8 credits during the school year. Grade 11 and 12 students must take 7 credits.
     Study halls are assigned to blocks in which you do not have a class, with the exception of seniors. Study halls are for
     cleaning up your homework load or for studying for a quiz or test.</p>
</div>
<div class="requirements2">
  <h4>Required Courses</h4>
  <p>Throughout your high school, there will be courses that you are required to take in order to graduate. You should factor in
     these courses when managing your schedule. Any failed mandatory course must be retaken.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Grade 9: Language Arts, Modern European History, New Testament - Acts & Epistles, (Honors)Biology, PE</li>
       <li>Grade 10: World Religions, Biblical Ethics, Asian Studies, PE</li>
       <li>Grade 11: Life Calling</li>
       <li>Grade 12: Christian Apologetics</li>
       <li>Health must be taken in either 10th grade or above.</li>
     </ul>
</div>
<div class="retaking" id="retaking">
  <h2>Retaking Courses</h2>
  <p>Courses can be retaken if you have a C or below, but the maximum possible grade that can be attained will be a B. The
     course with the higher grade will be used to calculate your GPA while the course with the lower grade will show up on
     your transcript with an "R". It is not recommended to retake a course in which you passed.</p>
  <p>Some courses can be retaken more than once for credit: music, theater arts, theater technology, video production,
     yearbook, PE team sports, and Worship on the Word.</p>
</div>
<div class="honors" id="honors">
  <h2>Honors/AP Courses</h2>
  <p>There are two types of honors courses: dedicated and layered. Some courses are by default honors courses, which means they are
     dedicated honors courses, and will provide honors credits. Other courses can be taken as an honors course, but also has a regular
     course. These are layered courses. Honors students are expected to complete more work with more quality. It is possible to
     switch from an honors course to a regular course before the mid-quarter.</p>
  <p>AP (Advanced Placement) courses are higher level courses that prepare students for college. These classes often have a much
     higher work load compared to other classes. Most of the material covered in class is or is based on college level material.
     Taking multiple AP classes in one year can be very stressful, so a maximum of 2 or 3 AP classes per year is recommended.</p>
  <p>AP exams take place in May and require the student to register for it.</p>
  <p>Here are the AP courses currently offered by ICS:</p>

</div>
<div class="online" id="online">
  <h2>Online Courses</h2>
  <p>ICS is currently partnered with Sevenstar Academy, an online learning platform for taking online courses. Online courses
     can be taken in addition to regular courses. It is possible to register for an online course if your schedule is full so
     that your schedule can be more flexible. This does not mean that you should take many online courses, because they add to
     your work load and will stress you out. Taking courses online requires a high amount of disciple. There won't be a teacher
     or mentor that will remind you to study or turn in your homework. This also means that you are able to work at your own
     pace. ICS also offers the Introduction to Computer Science course in addition to the Sevenstar Academy courses.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that online courses are not paid by the school. It will be your responsibility to make sure the course's
     fee is paid.</p>
     <p>A maximum of two credits per year can be earned from online courses.</p>
</div>
<div class="prerequisites" id="prerequisites">
  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>Many courses will require you to have taken other courses before you can take that course. If you plan on taking a course
     with a prerequisite, make sure you have met the requirements, or you'll have trouble managing your schedule later on. An
     example would be if you plan on signing up for AP Chemistry, you'd need to have taken the Honors Chemistry class. That means
     taking the Honors Chemistry class in 10th grade would be a good idea. While many courses to do not have a <i>class</i>
     prerequisite, they still have a minimum grade level. For example, you must be 10th grade or higher to take the AP
     European History class.</p>
  <p>Some courses recommend you to take another course to help you understand more concepts more easily. These are not
    required, but are recommended.</p>
